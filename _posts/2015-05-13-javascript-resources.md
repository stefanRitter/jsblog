Over the past couple of years I’ve done a lot of reading and learning to spice up my JS skills. Although I know there’s always more to learn, if I were to go back in time to advice my past self this is what I would recommend to myself. I believe this to be a run down of the best resources to take you from a beginning jQuery-reliant JavaScript-er towards becoming a JS pro.

## Vanilla JavaScript
1. John Reisig’s Tricks of the JavaScript Ninja
2. Effective JavaScript
3. Breitwald’s JavaScript Allonge & JavaScript Spressore
4. Yahoo JavaScript series by Douglas Crockford
5. Oh my JS by Azat Mardan
6. Answering the HTML5 boilerplate front-end interview questions

## Node / IO.js
- CodeSchool’s Node course
- NodeSchool.io

## Performance
- Steve Saunder’s books

- Jankfree / HTML5 Rocks

- Udacity’s Performance courses

## AngularJS
There are thousands of Angular tutorials and books out there. It’s a very popular framework. If I would have to recommend one and one only book on Angular, however, I’d know immediately which one I would recommend:

**AngularJS: Up and Running**

The book is co-authored by Brad Green, who leads the Angular team at Google. And it shows. This book will teach you Angular how it was intended to be used, starting you off with testing your app properly right from the start.

## ReactJS
React is a must learn. If you’re familiar with any front end MVC framework, React will feel like a breeze to learn. There are basically only to main concepts to understand:

1. everything in React is a component
2. some components have state

The best way to learn React at the moment is via the main site’s tutorials. There are books starting to appear, but React’s API is still changing rapidly as it approaches 1.0 so these books are already out of date by now.

## Canvas, Audio API & Gaming
There is one resource I can’t recommend high enough to learn these shiny new-ish HTML5 features:

**Udacity’s HTML5 Game Dev course**

The course will talk you through thinking in frames per second and writing pixels to Canvas rather than thinking in DOM trees. It’s a very demanding course, but worth every bit of effort you put into it — even when you’re not intending to ever become a game developer: your debugging skills will benefit from getting into a frame per second mindset, and learning more about the mechanics of rendering will make you more sensitive to the performance implications of how you build your DOM.

## Animations
This is tough one to give recommendations on, the area is changing so rapidly and animations is something really best learned by doing, tweaking and trying it yourself. 

Here are some great resources to start you off with animations:

- [CSS 3D transforms by David Desandro](https://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/)
- Rachel Nabor’s Web Animation Weekly
