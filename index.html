  <h2>Summary &amp; About me</h2>
  <p>This is the course I wish I had when I was just a beginning front-end engineer preparing for my first big interviews!</p>
  <p>Programming you learn by doing, and you get better at it by getting feedback from more advanced engineers.</p>
  <p>
    That is why this course is based on <strong>real world interview coding challenges</strong>,
    which you solve once a week and at your own pace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every challenge you submit is followed by a <strong>personal code review</strong> from my side.
    This will help you validate your solution and it will also help you become a better programmer along the way.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Who am I?</strong>
    <br>
    Iâ€™m lead front-end developer at a startup in London with over half a million page views per month.
    I've sat on both sides of the interview table many times. And I have experience in teaching programming to absolute beginners and mentoring experienced programmers alike.

  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>This is not an introduction to front-end or JavaScript programming.</p>
  <p>
    You are on the right level for this course if you can answer most of
    <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions">the questions from this html5-boilerplate repo</a>
    comfortably.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you had problems answering the questions or you're generally looking to improve your skills check out my post on
    <a href="/javascript-resources" target="_blank">the best resources to become a JS Pro</a>.
  </p>
  <p>That said the challenges will be done at your own pace, so learning along the way is definitely one of the take aways from this course.</p>
